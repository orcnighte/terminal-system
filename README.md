# Manual Terminal Emulator in Python

A simple terminal emulator built from scratch in Python, simulating a Unix-like command-line interface. 
This project is designed for learning purposes to understand how shells and terminals work internally.

## Features

  - `mkdir` — create a new directory
  - `touch` — create a new file
  - `cat` — view file contents
  - `pwd` — show current directory
  - `exit` — close the terminal
- Educational project to understand the internals of terminal and shell behavior
